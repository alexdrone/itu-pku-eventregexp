This repository contains the files for the project: "Context-Aware Computing by Declarative Complex Event Processing" performed by a six members team: three members from the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU) in Denmark and three members from the Peking University (PKU) in China. 

To define the project, the following problem description is given: ”How can a context-aware application be developed in global collaboration based on the GenieHub and complex-event processing, and how suitable is it to describe and implement complex event patterns needed for the context-aware application using dynamic condition response rules as described in the introduction slides of the project? ”

The people who participated in this global software development project from the IT University of Copenhagen are:
- Alex Usbergo (member)
- Luca Querella (member)
- Tom Pronk (member)
- Thomas Hildebrandt (Coordinator)

The participants from the Peking University are: 
- Song Chao (member coordinator)
- WuXin Tao (member)
- Qin Qian (member)
- Fuqiang Wang (member)
